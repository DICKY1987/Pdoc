## 1) Scope & Principles
This document unifies the GUI modernization plan into one cohesive specification. It defines the application architecture, indicator plugin model, signal normalization, conditional-probability semantics, validation UX, navigation/tabs, alerting, theming, and test/rollout plans. It is **implementation-agnostic** (no code) and **excludes** concrete currency-strength layouts and engine wiring.

**Design tenets**
- **Safety-first:** Strong validation, guardrails, and risk transparency.
- **Extensible:** Indicator plugins, auto-forms, grid layout, and signal contracts.
- **Observable:** Unified telemetry, history, and analytics.
- **Consistent:** Single EventBus taxonomy and StateManager as source of truth.
- **Accessible:** Theme tokens, clear states, keyboard ops, and text contrast.
